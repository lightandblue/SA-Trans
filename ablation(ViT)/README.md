# Introduction

    <em> 
    Figure 1: An overview of our SA-Net. Multi-modal multi-level features extracted from our multi-modal encoder are fed to two cascaded synergistic attention (SA) modules followed by a progressive fusion (PF) module. The short names in the figure are detailed as follows: CoA = co-attention component. CA = channel attention component. AA = AiF-induced attention component. RB = residual block. Pn = the nth saliency prediction. (De)Conv = (de-)convolutional layer. BN = batch normalization layer. FC = fully connected layer.
    </em>
</p>

In this work, we propose Synergistic Attention Network (SA-Net) to address the light field salient object detection by establishing a synergistic effect between multimodal features with advanced attention mechanisms. Our SA-Net exploits the rich information of focal stacks via 3D convolutional neural networks, decodes the high-level features of multi-modal light field data with two cascaded synergistic attention modules, and predicts the saliency map using an effective feature fusion module in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmark datasets show that our SA-Net outperforms 28 state-of-the-art models, sufficiently demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

> Note: An advanced transformer-based multi-head synergistic attention netowrk, which outprtforms this version on all three benchmark datasets by a large margin, is now available. The codes will be released soon (Contact: yi.zhang1@insa-rennes.fr).
